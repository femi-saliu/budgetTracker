BudgetTracker iOS App Planning
**************************************

Budget Class:
- Store SubBudgets in a data structure
	I believe that an arraylist or vector would be the best way to store the SubBudgets because we need a data structure with the ability to change its size dynamically.
- Total Amount of Money
	The user should be able to see the sum of the remaining amount of money from all Budgets.
- Transaction Histoty
	A record of all of the recent transactions from each of the Budgets all in one place. The user should be able to control how long this data is stored on their phone.
- Create new SubBudget
	An option to create a new SubBudget and allocate some money to it
- Delete SubBudget
	An option to remove a subBudget and reallocate any money that it had to other Budgets.
- Allocate funds / Change total Budget
	The ability to deposit money in each of the SubBudgets
- Transfer Funds
	The ability to move a given amount of money from one SubBudget to another

SubBudget Class:
- Name
	The user's chosen name for the SubBudget

Settings
- Currency 
	The type of money that the user spends (depends on country of residence)
- OverBudget 
	The user should be able to decide whether the app will let them spend more than their budget allows

	An action that exports all of the users budget info into either an excel document or email
	Maybe the user can have this export of data performed automatically every time interval
- Select time interval	
	The ability to choose the time interval that the budget tracking is based around.
	This affects when each budget refreshes, when data is exported from the app and more.
